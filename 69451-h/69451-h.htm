<p>“I keep hearing about laws for women. Where are
they?” This was the question asked by a woman working
twelve hours a day in a restaurant. What must we
tell her? What excuse have we to offer for excluding
her from the protection the law gives to women working
in factories and mercantile establishments? That we
have safeguarded women in these fields of employment
from overwork proves that we know the dangers of overwork,
that long hours interpreted in terms of human life
mean exhaustion, disease, immorality, pauperism and a
weaker generation to follow our own. This is an old
story, it has been told again and again. Yet with our
over-sensitiveness to an encroachment upon the rights
and liberties of American citizens, we have failed to extend
the protection of our laws to all who need their protection.</p>

<p>The New York State Labor Law as it stands makes
it illegal to employ women in factories and mercantile
establishments more than fifty-four hours or six days in
any one week, or between ten o’clock at night and six
o’clock in the morning. So far, so good. If these laws
are enforced, we may feel fairly confident that women in
these branches of industry at least have some measure
of protection. But what of the women not safeguarded
by the law? Who are they, and why should they be neglected?</p>

<p>Between fifteen and twenty thousand of these women
are workers in restaurants—waitresses, cooks, kitchen
girls, pantry hands—upon whose services all of us depend
at one time or another for our comfort and pleasure. The
Consumers’ League of New York City has long felt the
need of including restaurant workers under the provisions
of the Labor Law. The State Department of Labor lays
special stress upon this need.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Believing, therefore, both
from casual observation and from the statement of the
Labor Department that women in restaurants are not
properly guarded from industrial strain, the League
planned to explore the field further, to discover just
what actually are the hours, wages and general conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
of work in this branch of industry and to learn their
effect upon the life and health of the worker.</p>

<p>A valuable study of this subject was made in 1910 by
the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for New
York and several of the larger cities of the country.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Though the Consumers’ League has not entered upon
wholly new ground, yet with adequate time for detailed
study it has been possible for it to make a more exhaustive
inquiry than any made heretofore, and to bring to
light new phases of the question. The story of its discoveries
is told in the pages that follow, to this end, that
with wider knowledge of facts, public interest may be
reawakened and stimulated to demand adequate legal
protection for women employed in restaurants.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PLAN_OF_STUDY">PLAN OF STUDY.</h2>

</div>

<p>Believing that one of the most satisfactory sources
of information in regard to labor conditions is the word
of the workers themselves, the Consumers’ League decided
to base its study mainly upon interviews with
restaurant employees. One thousand and seventeen
(1,017) women were interviewed in New York City and
in six of the larger cities of the State. They were seen
in their homes, at their places of employment and through
employment agencies.</p>

<p>In New York City all the interviews were held at the
Occupational Clinic of the Board of Health, where,
through the courtesy of Dr. Harris, Chief of the Bureau
of Industrial Hygiene, a room was set aside for the use
of the League investigator. In response to a requirement
of the Health Department, all food-handlers in the city
come to the Clinic for a physical examination and certificate
testifying that they are free from communicable
disease. The investigator could in this way meet the
women on neutral ground when there was no temptation
to conceal or distort facts, and talk confidentially with
them. The interviews taken at the Clinic in five months
would have required at least a year to get in any other
way.</p>

<p>The New York State Consumers’ League and the
branch leagues in Buffalo, Syracuse and Mr. Vernon co-operated
in interviewing women in localities outside of
New York City, and the same undesirable conditions were
found to prevail throughout the State.</p>

<p>Supplementary information was also obtained from
all other available sources, such as employers, employment
agencies, girls’ clubs and published reports. The
workers came from every kind of restaurant, including
hotels, tea-rooms, buffet and dairy lunches, cafeterias
and clubs. In this way it was possible to get in touch
with a thoroughly representative group of workers, including
the best paid as well as the most underpaid.</p>

<p>In undertaking the investigation, the League sought
to answer three questions: first, what are the actual conditions
of labor prevailing in the restaurants of New
York State; second, are these conditions such that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
worker may lead a wholesome, normal life; and third,
how do these conditions react through the individual
worker upon society as a whole.</p>

<p class="mt5">The Consumers’ League acknowledges its deep indebtedness
to Dr. Harris for the helpful interest that he
has taken in its work, and for his courtesy in allowing
the League investigator to take interviews at the Occupational
Clinic.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no class of employees who serve the public
so directly as do restaurant workers. Also, it is obviously
of vital interest to the public that those who serve
them in this way be strong and healthy since they are
in a position peculiarly adapted to spread disease. The
study just terminated has brought to light certain facts
which point to a grave danger to the individual worker,
to those whom she serves and to the community. Hard
work kept up for incredibly long hours, low pay, health
impaired and resistance to disease lowered through
fatigue—these are some of the facts which make action
on our part necessary, that restaurant work may be a
safe and wholesome occupation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WORKER">THE WORKER.</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Age"><span class="smcap">Age.</span></h3>

<p>An outstanding feature of restaurant work is the
presence in this occupation of a very large proportion of
girls and young women. One-fourth of all the workers
are under 21, and two-thirds under 30 years of age. (<a href="#diagram1">See
Diagram 1</a>). There are several reasons to account for
this fact.</p>

<p>A certain amount of excitement attaches to the work
of a restaurant waitress which appeals to young girls.
She sees and talks to a great many people; she likes the
noise and bustle and cheerful atmosphere of the dining
room. Also, the employer prefers young and pretty girls
as waitresses, especially where the customers are mostly
men. They help to make his place attractive and popular.
One waitress remarked, “When the girls get to
looking bad, they are laid off and someone else is put
in their place.”</p>

<p>As might be expected, restaurant cooks are a somewhat
older set of women than the waitresses, not quite
one-half being under 30 years. Their work requires
experience and the ability to think and plan. Considering
the nature and demands of the work, it is startling
to find that twenty per cent. of their number are girls
not yet 21 years old.</p>

<p>Over seventy-five per cent. of the kitchen girls and
other helpers<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are under 30, and nearly half under 21.
This is the youngest group. Their work needs no skill
or previous training, the chief requirement being physical
strength.</p>

<p>The youth of these restaurant workers gives rise to
two distinct dangers, a physical danger and a moral one.
Restaurant work necessarily involves many hours of
standing and walking, lifting and carrying heavy weights.
This is an unavoidable feature, but it is of the utmost
importance that it be not ignored. Medical authorities
have pointed out the serious results that follow the strain
of continued standing and over-work of young girls. Dr.
Harris states that in occupations which require such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
lifting and carrying and such long hours of standing
“there is a definite hazard to the child-bearing capacity
of women. This is of vital consequence to society as a
whole.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="diagram1" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/diagram1.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 1.</span>—Ages of Women Employed in Restaurants by Occupation.</p>
</div>

<p>The moral danger of the work is largely confined to
waitresses. Because of their position, they are peculiarly
exposed to the attentions of men customers. For
this very reason, the Baltimore Vice Commission recommends
that only older and more experienced women be
employed in this capacity, while in Norway the law sets
a minimum age limit for waitresses in public places.</p>

<p>If the restaurant worker is to resist the strain of
the work and the temptations to which she is exposed,
hours and conditions must be so adjusted as to prevent
all overtaxing of her strength and elasticity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="diagram2" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/diagram2.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 2.</span>—Nationality of Women Restaurant Workers.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Nationality"><span class="smcap">Nationality.</span></h3>

<p>The majority of restaurant workers are foreigners.
Less than one-third are American-born, and of these a
great many have foreign-born parents and live among
members of their own race, so that they can hardly be
classed as Americans. The largest single group is made
up of Austro-Hungarians. (<a href="#diagram2">See Diagram 2</a>). The demand
for cheap, unskilled labor in this occupation calls
for the kind of service which these girls and others of
the European peasant class can give. The outdoor life
in the fields of their native land fits them for the hard
labor required in a restaurant kitchen. They do not remain
fit long, however. After a year or two of this work,
much of their sturdiness is lost, color and brightness are
gone from their faces, and they have become pale and
listless. A curiously dull, passive look is characteristic
of many of them.</p>

<p>Living as they do among their own people these young
peasants have no opportunity to absorb American standards
and customs. Their ignorance makes it easy for
employers to exploit them, demanding hours of labor
and paying wages to which no American girl would submit.
An employment agent said: “My ’phone rings day
and night—all want peasant girls for kitchen helpers
because they are the only kind that will stand such long
hours.” Attempts to organize restaurant workers in
New York State have never succeeded. The Secretary
of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees’ International
Alliance, speaking of their unsuccessful efforts along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
this line in New York City in 1915, says, “This is not the
first attempt to organize the girls. We have had a similar
experience before,—in fact have had three experiences
in that city and none of them a bit more encouraging
than the present one.” This is largely due to the
presence of so great a number of young foreign girls in
this occupation. They are not in a position to unite and
work for their own protection. The only channel through
which that protection can come is the law.</p>

<p>While the greater number of restaurant workers are
unmarried, it is rather surprising to find so large a proportion
of married women in the work. (<a href="#diagram4">See Diagram
4.</a>) This is easily explained, however, by the fact that
many of them are “one-meal” girls, that is, they are employed
only for the rush hour at noon. In this way they
can earn a little extra money while their husbands are at
work, either as “pin-money” for themselves, or to help
toward the support of the children.</p>

<p>The majority of restaurant employees live with their
family or relatives (<a href="#diagram3">See Diagram 3</a>), but this does not
mean that they are not entirely self-dependent. As large
a proportion of a girl’s wage goes into the family exchequer
as she would have to pay for board and lodging
elsewhere. The financial advantage of living at home
appears chiefly in giving her a place of refuge when she
is out of a job.</p>

<p>Restaurant workers are a tenement house population.
A few, to be sure, can afford comfortable little apartments
of their own, but as a whole their lot falls within
the congested tenement districts of the city. Confusion,
over-crowding, dirt, lack of sunlight, air and privacy,
and unwholesome surroundings are only too common in
their homes. The janitor of an East Side tenement house
said: “A little while ago down in Third Street there
were twenty-three girls sleeping in two rooms. They’d
put their mattresses down on the floor at night and pile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
them on top of each other in the day time. Most of
them were kitchen hands at ⸺’s,” naming a well-known
chain of restaurants.</p>

<p>The low standards of the European peasant class
from which restaurant workers are largely recruited,
drag down all standards. No other result is possible
under present conditions. They live—but how? Low
wages, miserably long hours, no opportunity to fit themselves
for their new surroundings—this is what we offer
these young peasant girls who come to America confidently
expecting better things than they have left behind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOURS">HOURS.</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Weekly_Hours_of_Labor"><span class="smcap">Weekly Hours of Labor.</span></h3>

<p>The salient characteristic of restaurant work is the
length of the working day. Fifty-eight per cent. of the
women employees work each week beyond the fifty-four-hour
limit set by law for women in stores and factories.
A twelve-hour day and a seven-day week is the lot of one-fifth
of these workers. (<a href="#diagram5">See Diagram 5.</a>) A fifteen-hour
day is not uncommon. Not quite one-half of the waitresses
work over 54 hours a week or 9 hours a day. The
reason for this is that a large number of them, 31 per
cent., are “one-meal girls.” <i>Seventy-eight per cent.</i> of
all other restaurant workers, however, exceed the fifty-four
hour week.</p>

<p>Comparing the hours of labor of these women with
the hours of labor of all employees, both male and
female, in the factories of New York State, four per cent.
of the factory employees and thirty-five per cent. of
the women restaurant employees work over sixty hours
a week. Two per cent. of the factory employees and
twenty per cent. of the women in restaurants work seventy-two
hours or over.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 6.</span>—Comparison of Weekly Hours of Labor for Women in
Restaurants and all Factory Employees in New York State.</p>
</div>

<p>Shorter hours have been brought about in factories
by the voluntary action of manufacturers, who recognize
the inefficiency of over-worked men and women; by
concerted action of the workers, who have united to fight
for their own protection; and by legal enactment, proving
that the people of New York State are alive to the
dangers of overwork. Some restaurant managers realize
the waste and harm of too long hours and arrange their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
employees’ time accordingly; most of them do not. Women
restaurant workers in New York State have never
been successfully organized; they cannot protect themselves.
They have no legal redress for overwork; the
law has neglected them. In the course of this investigation,
a girl of twenty was found working one hundred
and twenty-two hours a week—longer than the law allows
factory employees to work in two weeks. Yet this
is within the law. Although restaurants differ from
stores and factories in keeping open more hours a day,
and sometimes for the whole twenty-four, a system of
shifts would do away with the scandalously long hours
to which thousands of girls and women are bound.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 5.</span>—Weekly Hours of Labor of Women Employed in Restaurants.</p>
</div>

<p>That restaurant work is at best a great drain upon
the physical strength and nervous force of the worker
is evident. Standing, walking, lifting and carrying heavy
weights is unavoidable. The report on restaurants made
by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics says:
“There was much complaint among the waitresses that
the work was very hard and they could stand it but a few
years. A number of the girls interviewed had worked
as three meal girls until their health was broken; then
they took positions as one meal girls and barely made a
living. Carrying the heavy trays and the constant standing
and walking cause ill health. Usually a man is employed
to carry away the empty dishes, but the waitresses
must bring the trays loaded with food.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Besides the cost to endurance, nerves are at constant
tension for hurry is the remorseless rule. A waitress
must not only remember a multitude of orders and fill
them quickly, but she must keep her temper under the
exactions of the most trying customer. The cook must
keep her head amid the confusion and noise of a hot,
crowded kitchen. The kitchen girl must be everywhere
at once with a helping hand and the dish-washer’s very
job depends upon her quickness. One of this latter group
said that she washes seven thousand articles in an hour
and a half. A waitress, when asked the effect of the
work upon her, answered, “Sore feet and a devilish mean
disposition.” A man restaurant worker speaking of
kitchen girls remarked, “It’s no work for a woman.
They have to lift heavy pots full of vegetables and fill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in all the gaps. A man has some endurance, but a woman
can’t stand it more than nine hours a day.”</p>

<p>Many kinds of work are difficult and taxing in their
performance, but if the working day is not prolonged beyond
a certain point, and there is a sufficient period of
rest, such work is not necessarily injurious to the health
of the worker. If this point is passed, health is impaired.</p>

<h3 id="The_Day_of_a_Restaurant_Worker"><span class="smcap">The Day of a Restaurant Worker.</span></h3>

<p>The day of a restaurant worker does not begin with
her arrival at the restaurant nor end when she leaves.
Half of these women live at a distance, taking thirty
minutes or more to reach their place of employment.
When this extra hour spent in going to and from work
is added to a twelve hour day, it is a factor to be reckoned
with. It means cutting off an already insufficient night’s
rest, and, when a girl cannot afford carfare, a weary
walk home after being on her feet all day. Nor is this all.
Only a few of the best-paid waitresses can afford to pay
for the laundering of their aprons and uniforms. Consequently
this must be done by the girl herself, adding
another burden to a load already too heavy.</p>

<p>The law requires that girls in factories and stores
have at least one-half hour off for luncheon. This does
not apply to restaurant workers. The “one-meal” girls
eat before and after serving, but the majority of the
“two-meal” and full-time girls have no time at all for
meals. They must eat when they can snatch a moment
from their work. There were many complaints of indigestion
and loss of appetite from the workers as a result
of haste and irregularity in taking their meals. One
girl remarked, “You’re glad to grab ’em any way you
can round here,” and another said, “It’s a wonder more
girls aren’t dead, the way they eat all of a rush. Often
the smell of food all the time takes away my appetite so
I can’t eat any way.”</p>

<p>A regular time off for meals would be of great benefit
to the worker not only in allowing her to eat quietly and
comfortably, but in giving her a little rest. In some
restaurants after the noon rush is over the girls can sit
down and do “side-work,” folding napkins, polishing silver,
filling salt-cellars, etc. The greater number of girls,
however, have no so-called “idle time.” They must be
on their job continuously. In other restaurants the girls
work on a “split trick,” that is, they have one or two
hours off in the afternoon. This is a very unpopular arrangement.
Not only does it keep them out late in the
evening, but they cannot use their free time to good advantage.
There is little opportunity for recreation or
social intercourse during these hours because they come
in the morning or afternoon when the girls’ friends are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
all at work. Nor is there ordinarily time for fresh air
and exercise, especially in the case of the kitchen workers.
A waitress usually has only to take off her apron
to be ready for the street, but the other women have not
time to change to street clothes and back again in their
free period. They stay in the hot kitchen because no
other place is provided.</p>

<p>Up at six, away at 6:30, home at 8 o’clock at night
worn out by the wear and tear of twelve hours’ toil, a
dress and an apron to be washed and ironed for tomorrow—after
a day like this, what spirit or strength is
left to a girl for play and the friendly relations that safeguard
her from moral danger? It is a significant fact
that with few exceptions the restaurant worker is not
known to settlements and girls’ clubs. She does not
share the group interests and social life open to other
working girls. Neither does she make friends with her
fellow-workers—the spring and vitality needed to win
and establish friendships has been lost under the deadening
effect of overwork.</p>

<p>According to Miss Mary Van Kleeck’s estimate in
her study of “Working Girls in Evening Schools,” less
than one per cent. of those attending were restaurant
workers. They simply have not the physical strength
for outside activities and interests. Time after time in
answer to the question “What do you do in the evening?”
came the reply, “Oh, I go right to bed.” One
girl, who left the work because of broken health, said,
“If I went out in the evening I’d be sick the next day,
and the boss would say I couldn’t expect to do good work
if I stayed out late at night.”</p>

<p>The report on restaurants of the Chicago Juvenile
Protective Association, emphasizes a truth too much
ignored when it says: “The entire investigation revealed
once more the hideous risks of the excessively fatigued
and overworked girl, who is able to obtain the rest and
comfort she craves only through illicit channels.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3 id="Night_Work"><span class="smcap">Night Work and One Day’s Rest in Seven.</span></h3>

<p>Although the number of women employed in restaurants
at night is not great, night work in this occupation
is a factor to be seriously considered. The restaurants
which employ women at night are the small establishments
in the tenement districts of the city where hours
are longest and surroundings most trying; the cheaper
restaurants in the theatre districts where the employment
of women is an added attraction to after-the-theatre
supper parties; and restaurants in railway stations
which are necessarily open all night.</p>

<p>The law makes it illegal to employ women in factories
and mercantile establishments between 10 p. m. and 6 a. m.
The reasons which caused the state to exercise its police
power to safeguard the health and morals of these classes
of workers apply equally to the employment of women in
restaurants. The very fact that only four per cent. of
the workers interviewed were employed at night proves
that night work for women in restaurants is not a necessary
evil. That it is an evil is beyond question.</p>

<p>The dangers of night work are two-fold. First, it is
a distinct menace to the health of the worker. The Factory
Investigating Commission in its Report to the Legislature
for 1913, states: “The chief danger to health
from night work is ... due to the inevitable lack of
sleep and sunlight. Recuperation from fatigue takes
place fully only in sleep, and best in sleep at night. Hence
night work is, in a word, against nature. This injury to
health is all the greater because sleep lost at night by
working women is never fully made up by day. For,
in the first place, sleep in the day time is not equal in recuperative
power to sleep at night.... Moreover,
quiet and privacy for sleep by day is almost impossible
to secure. Upon returning home in the middle of the
night or at dawn the workers can snatch at most only a
few hours’ rest.”</p>

<p>Often a woman will have one week of night work
alternating with a week of work in the day time. She
hardly gets accustomed to sleeping by day when she is
taken off the night shift, to change back again at the end
of the week. Thus it is impossible for her to form regular
habits in sleeping and eating.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is a grave moral danger involved in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
night work, especially for restaurant workers since at
this time they are open to the attentions of an undesirable
class of men. “I don’t like to work at night,” one
young waitress said. “The men are always fresher to
girls at night than in the day time. Perhaps it’s because
so many of those gamblers come in drunk.” Nor is it
safe for a woman to go home alone after twelve o’clock
at night. Instances of hideous occurrences are familiar
to everyone. A little widow, the mother of seven children,
told the investigator that she had given up her
work as a dishwasher for this very reason. A friend of
hers working in a nearby restaurant, was set upon,
robbed and killed on her way home from work late one
night. “I changed my work then,” said the woman,
“for what would the children do if anything happened
to me?”</p>

<p>The majority of restaurants employ men for night
duty. It is evident, therefore, that the employment of
women is not essential to the convenience and comfort
of either restaurant owners or customers.</p>

<p>In nearly every branch of industry the working week
is six days long. It is universally conceded that there
must be one day in the seven for rest and relaxation if
men and women are to give their best service. With
restaurant workers, thirty-three per cent. of whom have
no day of rest in seven, the need for such a time is particularly
great because of the long working day. Otherwise
they have no opportunity for a thorough rest and
the poisons of fatigue are not thrown off. If these
poisons are not eliminated, they accumulate in the system
and finally result in physical breakdown.</p>

<p>And not only is this free day important on the score
of health, but it is also the time for recreation and the
strengthening of family ties. For the girl who has no
leisure, no time for real relaxation and play, there is
only a starved and empty existence. A woman who has
no opportunity to be with and to know her children, who
must leave them to the care of friends or a day nursery
or the street, who has no day in the week to be at home
with them, can hardly be a potent factor in shaping their
lives. She suffers and so do the children, and the stability
of such a family life is at best uncertain. One woman
said, “If I get a half day off on Sunday to be with my
children, it makes me happy all the week.”</p>

<p>Who are the workers that bear the brunt of the long
hours in restaurants? They are for the most part the
younger women and girls—those who are most likely to
be injured by overstrain. They are the very ones whom
it is to society’s interest to protect most carefully since
by their strength is measured the strength of the next
generation. Less than thirty per cent. of all workers
exceeding fifty-four hours a week are over thirty years
of age. (<a href="#diagram7">See Diagram 7.</a>)</p>

<p>Foreign-born women also make up the greater part of
this group. (<a href="#diagram8">See Diagram 8.</a>) They do not know how to
protect themselves from employers’ unreasonable demands,
they must have work and they are not trained
for anything except unskilled labor. They will work
any number of hours exacted by the employer whatever
the cost, until exhaustion renders them unfit for labor of
any kind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WAGES">WAGES.</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Weekly_Wages"><span class="smcap">Weekly Wages.</span></h3>

<p>The wage of restaurant workers is of immediate interest
to everyone who enters a restaurant. You not
only pay for your food, but your tip helps to pay the
waitress’s salary. It is upon this source of income that
she depends for the greater part of her earnings. Any
study of wages in this branch of industry must take into
consideration not only that tips form a large part of the
income of waitresses but that the majority of women
get all their meals at the restaurant, or the equivalent of
$3.00 a week in addition to actual wages.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Professor
Streightoff has fixed upon $9.00 a week as the minimum
amount upon which a girl can live independently in New
York City.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Eighty-seven per cent of all women restaurant
workers are being paid less than $9.00, but when
food and tips are estimated and added, the proportion
receiving less than a living wage is thirty-one per cent.
While it is true therefore that the majority of workers in
restaurants are earning enough to support themselves, it
is a matter for grave concern that so large a number of
women are being forced below the lowest point at which
they can maintain health and decency.</p>

<p>Moreover this $9.00 a week minimum does not allow
for saving against illness, dentist’s bills, unemployment
or any other emergency. Taking $10.00 a week as the
least upon which a girl can live and save, we find that
forty-nine per cent. of these women are receiving in
actual wages or their equivalent less than this amount.
A few restaurant workers live at their place of employment,
thus receiving lodging as well as board, but as this
is true of only four per cent., the proportion is too small
to affect appreciably the wage scale as a whole.</p>

<p>It is upon the kitchen and pantry hands who make up
twenty-eight per cent. of all the workers that the burden
of low wages falls most heavily. Waitresses have the
opportunity to make tips, cooks receive comparatively
fair wages because their work requires a certain amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of skill, but the other women cannot make tips and their
unskilled labor is very poorly paid. One-third are receiving
less than $6.00 a week, and three-fourths less than
$7.00. (<a href="#diagram9">See Diagram 9.</a>)</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 9.</span>—Weekly Wages of Women Employed in Restaurants.</p>
</div>

<p>The income of a restaurant worker is not clear gain.
Certain expenses are involved in the work which she
must meet herself. In restaurants where a special dress
is required the waitress must provide her own uniforms,
and she must also either wash them herself, or pay for
having them laundered. Two clean uniforms a week is
the usual requirement and in some cases three. The report
of the United States Labor Department estimates
that it costs a girl about $0.63 a week for the laundering
of her aprons alone.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It costs $0.25 to have a uniform
laundered, which means $1.13 must be deducted from the
$3.50 a week usually paid to waitresses in tea-rooms,
where special dresses are always required. In one New
York tea-room the girls must have two sets of uniforms,
a white dress with white shoes, and a blue dress with
black shoes. Each uniform costs $2.50.</p>

<p>Fines also eat into the restaurant worker’s earnings.
Girls are commonly fined for lateness, one particular
restaurant exacting $0.25 if a girl is ten minutes late.
Her pay is always cut for breakage, and in some places
a certain amount is deducted weekly whether she breaks
any dishes or not. Also, mistakes in adding up checks,
either over or under the correct amount, and mistakes in
orders, must be paid for by the waitress. “Those are
the things that make the girls mad,” said one. In one
New York tea-room this summer, a customer was served
with hot coffee, when she had asked for iced tea, the
waitress misunderstanding the order. The mistake was
corrected and the iced tea substituted. When the waitress
brought the customer her check, however, both tea and
coffee were charged, and the girl laid down twenty cents
upon the table. “You know, we have to pay for our
mistakes,” she said.</p>

<p>What low wages mean in actual living cannot be expressed
by figures. Poor quarters in questionable parts
of the city, clothing of the most utilitarian kind, no
money for the pretty things that every well-constituted
girl wants, nothing for recreation, and worst of all, debts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
after illness or unemployment which take the very heart
out of a girl in the bitter struggle to pay them off. The
proprietor of a Buffalo employment agency remarked,
“Look at the Wants Ads; with the many factories in
Buffalo you will find the list “Help Wanted for Restaurants”
equals that of “Help Wanted for Factory Work,”
and what does that mean?—Simply that the restaurant
workers are a discontented lot and all because of the excessively
long hours and low wages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

  Income (dotted line) of Waitresses in Restaurants.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="The_Tipping_System"><span class="smcap">The Tipping System.</span></h3>

<p>Tipping is a direct drag upon wages. When the public
is perfectly willing to contribute part of a waitress’s
wage, why should not the employer take advantage of
this fact and pay her less? That is surely to be expected
and is almost universally the case. Many girls, accustomed
to making a good deal in tips or “scale,” as they
call it, would not be willing to work for $9.00 a week
and no tips, for they can often make more than this
amount. But the better class of girl would prefer a
living wage and no tips. As matters stand now, however,
they are a very necessary part of a girl’s income.</p>

<p>Comparing the weekly wage and the weekly income
of waitresses as shown in <a href="#diagram10">Diagram 10</a>, we find that without
tips only 8 per cent. make as much as $9.00 a week,
while with tips 50 per cent. receive $9.00 or more. The
custom of tipping has two distinct disadvantages.
First, it is an unreliable source of income. A girl may
reasonably expect to make a certain amount in tips, but
she cannot count upon doing so. The danger here is not
only that she will receive less than it is possible for her
to live on, but that she will get into debt, trusting to luck
that her tips will be large enough to get her out. It is
very easy to be over-confident. A tea-room waitress
said: “Sometimes I make $12.00 a week in tips, sometimes
almost nothing. You can’t depend on people.”
Tea-rooms are the greatest sinners in respect to making
their waitresses depend upon tips. The usual wage in
several of the well-known New York tea-rooms is $3.50
a week for full time, which is ten or twelve hours a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>The other aspect of tipping presents a more subtle
danger. The girls need the money and they deliberately
work for it, partly by good service, and partly by adopting
an intimate personal tone toward their men customers.
This leads naturally to familiarity on the man’s
part and establishes a personal relation between them.
Most of the girls quite frankly admit making “dates”
with strange men. In one restaurant a woman was
pointed out in incredulous admiration by the other waitresses.
“Her husband has been dead four years, and
she hasn’t gone out with a man yet,” they said. These
“dates” are made with no thought on the part of the
girl beyond getting the good time which she cannot afford
herself, but the outcome is often a tragedy. The
restaurants in one city of the state forbid unnecessary
conversation between waitress and customer because
conditions resulting from the practice became so flagrant.
The result of this custom is that girls are approached
to whom any attention from their men customers
is most distasteful. The report of the United States
Bureau of Labor Statistics says: “Many of the waitresses
complain of the annoying attention of male customers.
Many girls said, however, that if they speak
sharply to a customer or offend him, they are likely to be
reprimanded by the head waitress and may even lose
their position.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Juvenile Protective Association of Chicago considers
tipping a vicious system. “The giving of tips
should be abolished because of their pernicious effect. A
young girl who under any other circumstances would
not dream of accepting money from a man will accept it
in the guise of a tip. In the hands of a vicious man this
tip establishes between him and the girl a relation of
subserviency and patronage which may easily be made
the beginning of improper attentions. The most conscientious
girl, dependent upon tips to eke out her slender
wage, finds it difficult to determine just where the line
of propriety is crossed. Thus, in addition to the other
dangers surrounding the girls employed in hotels and
restaurants, they encounter the lack of respect which
curiously attaches itself to one who accepts a gratuity.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with the question of wages is the
possibility of being out of a job. If a girl is earning
$10.00 a week she may be able, with the most careful
saving, to lay aside enough to tide her over two or three
weeks of unemployment. But the savings from a $10.00
weekly wage do not last long. Twenty-eight per cent. of
these women were out of work one month or longer in
the past year because of the slack season, illness, change
of their place of employment or for some other reason.
The girl who cannot save is in a desperate condition indeed.
For her, prolonged unemployment means debt,
heart breaking anxiety and dependence.</p>

<p>Girls in restaurant work do not get vacations with
pay except in very rare instances. One well-known New
York firm having tea-rooms in various parts of the city,
is to be congratulated on the fact that it does give its
waitresses a vacation with pay. A few of the married
women, or those who have families to care for them, can
afford to take time out of the year’s work for a rest. But
when a girl is not working, it is for the most part a
matter of stern necessity and inevitably means a time of
struggle and suffering.</p>

<p>Restaurants do not labor under the difficulties of seasonal
employment. We should expect to find a steadiness
in this occupation which the facts do not bear out. It is
therefore evident that the instability of the work and constant
shifting is due to the unsatisfactory nature of the
employment itself. The large proportion of workers out
of employment for one month or more a year (20%) is
striking evidence of this fact.</p>

<h3 id="Lack_of_Opportunity"><span class="smcap">Lack of Opportunity in Restaurant Work.</span></h3>

<p>Restaurant work is a “blind alley” trade. There is
little opportunity for development or advancement. What
training is necessary can be acquired in a few weeks, and
the only position to which a girl can look forward is that
of head waitress. There are no recognized degrees of
skill in any part of the work connected with a restaurant.
On the contrary, the tendency is in the direction of wearing
girls out by overstrain rather than of giving them a
chance. The girls who have been in the work the shortest
time get higher pay than those who have been in it
longest. Sixty-five per cent. of those who had been
working less than a year were getting $6.00 or more a
week, while only fifty-five per cent. of those who had been
working over ten years were receiving as much. (<a href="#diagram12">See
Diagram 12.</a>) The woman who remains in restaurant
work for more than a few years gradually loses her
strength and ability, and can get a position only with an
inferior type of restaurant, where the necessity for having
a job forces her to accept whatever wage is offered
her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUMMARY_OF_STUDY">SUMMARY OF STUDY.</h2>

</div>

<p>The law has declared illegal the employment of women
in mercantile establishments longer than fifty-four hours
or six days in any one week, on the ground that a working
day of more than nine hours, or a working week of
more than six days, is prejudicial to the health of the
worker and therefore to the welfare of society. It has
also declared illegal the employment of these women at
night and it safeguards their interests further by insisting
upon a definite period for the mid-day meal. Fifty-eight
per cent. (58%) of the women employed in restaurants
exceed the fifty-four hour limit, twenty per cent.
(20%) work twelve hours a day and four per cent.
(4%) are employed at night. One-third do not have
one day of rest in seven, and the majority are not allowed
time off for their meals. Do not these women also need
the protection of the law?</p>

<p>Restaurant work has much in common with work in
mercantile establishments. Continuous standing and
walking and the nervous strain entailed in serving many
customers are features of both occupations. Besides this,
restaurant work necessitates the lifting and carrying of
heavy weights which may easily be disastrous not only
to the worker herself, but to her children. Dr. Harris
has expressly stated his belief that such work will injure
the reproductive organs of a women unless she is guarded
from overstrain. The larger proportion of restaurant
workers are girls and young women, who are peculiarly
susceptible to overstrain because of their youth.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence from the testimony of the
girls themselves that restaurant work is a severe tax and
that the need for limiting hours of labor is strongly felt
among them. Here are quoted a few of the remarks made
by them, which could be duplicated many times:</p>

<p>“I think it’s a shame to let a woman work twelve
hours a day. I’m so tired at night I can’t do anything
but go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I can’t keep a job longer than four months because
I get so nervous.”</p>

<p>“This is my second week and I’m nearly dead, the
hours are so long.”</p>

<p>“It would be the grandest thing in the world if they
could do away with the twelve-hour day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>To resist the unavoidable strain of the work, the
restaurant worker must be in a normal, healthy state of
mind and body. Our responsibility lies in seeing to it
that conditions are such as to make this possible.</p>

<p>The results of fatigue do not end with the individual.
It is common knowledge that health depends upon the
power to resist disease. The person who has overworked
is not only subject to the devastating action of fatigue
poisons, but is a prey to any infections to which he may
be exposed because he cannot throw them off. Working
conditions which render large numbers of men and
women susceptible to disease, and hence capable of
spreading it, are a public menace. To allow such conditions
to continue unchecked is inexcusable negligence.</p>

<p>These facts point directly to the crying need for the
limitation of hours for women in restaurants, that the
individual worker may be protected from overstrain, that
the community may be guarded from the spread of contagious
disease by people predisposed to infection
through fatigue, and that the children of these women
may be strong and capable of becoming useful citizens.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that the difficulty of regulating
hours in restaurants is much greater than in mercantile
establishments. Restaurants must be open for a longer
period each day than any store needs to be or is likely to
be. But the difficulties are not insuperable. By working
the employees in shifts of nine consecutive hours a day
and six days a week, and by replacing women by men for
night duty, the most undesirable features of restaurant
work would be abolished. Such a plan has already been
tried successfully in a number of New York restaurants,
proving that it is possible and feasible to regulate hours.</p>

<p>To limit by law the hours of labor for women employed
in restaurants cannot be considered a new or revolutionary
step. New York is already far behind the majority
of other states in this respect. At the present time,
twenty-seven states regulate the number of hours that
women may work in restaurants, five having the eight-hour
day.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Clearly, therefore, the establishment of a
normal working day for this class of workers is not only
reasonable, but, in the opinion of the greater number of
states, it is essential to the best welfare of their people
as a whole.</p>

The Consumers’ League wishes to urge the inclusion

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(1) That the working day shall not exceed nine (9)
and the working week fifty-four (54) hours.</p>

<p class="hanging">(2) That women shall not be employed between the
hours of 10 p. m. and 7 a. m.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>At present restaurant employees do not come within
the provisions of the law relative to hours of labor of
females, or the day of rest law. To the casual observer
it is very evident that there is no other employment in
which males and females are employed, where the hours
of labor are so long, and where the employees are compelled
to be constantly on their feet. It is admitted that
there is no class of work in which so large a percentage
of females is employed. The Legislature has recognized
that the females working in restaurants should be protected
to some extent, by providing in section 17 of the
Labor Law that “Every person employing females—as
waitresses in a hotel or restaurant shall provide and
maintain suitable seats” but by the very nature of their
work the employees have no opportunity to use these
seats. There seems to be no good reason why the hours
of employment of females in restaurants should not be
subject to law as in mercantile establishments, and that
all those employed in the same should enjoy the benefits
of the day of rest law, as they do in other employments.
The evil resulting from restaurants being exempt from
the provisions of the Labor Law relating to hours and
day of rest, is shown in the fact that bakeries and confectionery
establishments have added to their business
the serving of sandwiches and lunches, and endeavor to
escape the provisions of the law by claiming that they
are exempt because they are operating a restaurant.
This illustrates the subterfuge to which many employers
will resort rather than comply with the law.</p>

THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF WOMEN EMPLOYEES

DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY
OF NEW YORK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From such opportunities for observation as our clinic
study afforded us, it is safe to say that this occupation
is one which may affect the health of women and in connection
with long hours and small wages may combine
to cause an increased existence of sickness among them.
The effect of work that requires standing and running
about while carrying loads for many hours during the
day will be particularly marked upon the generative organs
of the woman. The influence of the work in this
particular, which we are unfortunately unable to study,
because of the opposition it would inevitably arouse,
leads me to believe that from this standpoint alone, there
is a definite hazard to the child-bearing capacity of the
woman. This is of vital consequence to society as a
whole, as well as to the individual workers, and therefore
well justifies every effort to correct the undesirable conditions
that attend this occupation.</p>

POINT OF VIEW.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“A nine hour law would be a very good thing. I think
long hours are very bad for women in restaurants. Most
of them have varicose veins and flat feet, and a large
number suffer from stomach trouble. Look at me, I am
strong and healthy, but when I’m through at night, I am
just all in. It’s a dreadful nervous strain.</p>

<p>“Girls have to live on tips. If you tell the boss you
can’t make any, he says you are no good and discharges
you. You have to put up with it or starve. The majority
of girls—the better class of waitresses—if they
could get a good living would be glad to do without tips.
Of course it would be a revolution and would require a
lot of agitation.</p>

<p>“Girls in restaurant work have greater temptations
than most girls. Advances are always made, especially
in certain districts. A great number go wrong because
of so many advances.</p>

<p>“Nothing has ever been done for restaurant workers.
The bosses all seem to think we are a lot of crooks. Waitresses
think the same of them. Girls don’t change their
jobs so often because they like to. They get fired, mostly
because the manager just wants to, or the work is too
hard and the place miserable.</p>

<p>“There should be a nine-hour day, and two meals with
half an hour allowed for each. Hours should be arranged
consecutively. The best regulation would be to have
girls work in shifts, going on at eight and coming off at
five, or going on at eleven and working until eight. The
same arrangement could be made for the kitchen help.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
